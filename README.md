# FoxyScanner
FoxyScanner is a TCP Port Scanner coded in Bash. FoxyScanner allows you to scan all the TCP Ports. When FoxyScanner finishes, will create a txt file with the opened ports, also will copy the ports for facilitate the work with other tools like nmap (enumerate services, scan determinated ports...)

## Installing
Only grant execution permission:
`chmod +x foxyscanner.sh`

## How to use
Is really simple, only put the name of script followed by the required parameter (IP Address of your target) and wait. FoxyScanner will do the rest ;)
`./foxyscanner.sh <ip_address>`
